# The ACM Brand & Content Style Guide
The brand &amp; content style guide of the Association for Computing Machinery

## Purpose & Structure
This guide exists to help out anyone working with ACM's brand, intenally or externally. It's split up into two parts:
- The *repo*, which contains the logo and other visual brand assets (with larger assets represented by links)
- The *wiki*, which contains an in-depth brand guide and content style guide detailing brand usage guidelines, and how we speak as ACM

## Preface

### External Use
We provide this repo (and the upcoming brand page on the ACM site) to house ACM's official brand assets for your use in accordance with our listed guidelines. We ask you to use these instead of opting to use the national ACM's branding to represent ACM UTD, or opting to create stand-in ACM UTD brand assets yourself.

### Internal Use
This guide isn’t meant to be an end-all be-all to how PR is handled within ACM. Instead, consider it a big list of the way things are done so far. If you like how it’s done already, here’s an outline to get you doing it quickly. If you think it can be done better, go for it. If it doesn’t work, it’s all good — but if it does? Then update this guide to reflect what you’ve changed, and that’ll be the starting point for ACM going forward.

So feel free to innovate. That’s why you’re here.

The important takeaway is to stay consistent with whatever you choose to do — especially with marketing & PR, and especially with our voice.
