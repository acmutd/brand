## Usage Guidelines

### External Use
We provide this repo (and the upcoming brand page on the [_ACM_ site](https://www.acmutd.co)) to house _ACM_ official brand assets for your use in accordance with our listed guidelines. We ask you to use these instead of opting to use the national _ACM_ branding to represent the Association for Computing Machinery at the University of Texas at Dallas. If you represent an organization that at any point has or will partner with _ACM_ these brand assets are available to be incorporated into your designs and other promotional material.

### Internal Use
This guide isn’t meant to be an end-all be-all to how PR is handled within ACM. Instead, consider it a big list of the way things are done so far. If you like how it’s done already, here’s an outline to get you doing it quickly. If you think it can be done better, go for it. If it doesn’t work, it’s all good — but if it does? Then update this guide to reflect what you’ve changed, and that’ll be the starting point for _ACM_ going forward. Anyone can design for _ACM_, feel free to express your creativity and support _ACM_ to be the best we can be.

### Questions and Concerns

If you have a question regarding the appropriate usage of the offical brand assets of _ACM_ reach out to the [Director of Design](mailto:contact@acmutd.co). We will also be able to answer any questions regarding the modification or adaptation of the _ACM_ brand assets for specific use cases. If your question involves the incorporation of these assets in a digital format reach out to the [Director of Development](mailto:development@acmutd.co). 

## _ACM_ Vision

Being a part of _ACM_ means you have the talent and skills to push the frontiers of the organization forward. So feel free to innovate. That’s why you’re here. 

The important takeaway is to stay consistent with whatever you choose to do — especially with marketing & PR, and especially with our voice.
